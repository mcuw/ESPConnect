# Changelog

## 1.0.3
- Added a port-busy warning dialog when the serial device is in use, instead of showing bootloader tips.
- Skipping partition table read for ESP8266 (not supported).
- Improved flash size messaging: when detection fails, the UI now shows "Flash size not detected" instead of "Unknown".
- Code refactoring.

## 1.0.2
- Fix LittleFS not detected ([issue #10](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/ESPConnect/issues/10)). Many thanks to Jason2866 for the PR.
- Add delayed connection progress dialog (shows after 1s during connect) to improve user feedback.

## 1.0.1
- Fix octal flash size detection (map 0x30-0x3F RDID capacity codes when OCTAL feature present).
